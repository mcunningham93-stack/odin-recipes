        <p> This black bean soup is seasoned with a heavy hand. If you are salt- or spice-averse, decrease the amount of salt to 1½ tsp. and use 1 chipotle chile with 1 tsp. adobo sauce instead.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>8 oz.</b> slab or thick-cut bacon, cut into ¼" pieces </li>
                <li><b>1</b> large red onion</li>
                <li><b>2</b> medium carrots, scrubbed, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li><b>6 cloves</b> garlic, minced</li>
                <li><b>2½ sp.</b> kosher salt, divided, plus more</li>
                <li><b>3 cans</b> chipotle chiles in adobo, sliced crosswise, liquid reserved, plus 1 Tbsp. adobo sauce</li>
                <li><b>2 tsp.</b> dried oregano</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook bacon in Instant Pot on Sauté setting, stirring occasionally, until browned and most of the fat is released, 6–8 minutes. (If using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook bacon over medium-high heat.)</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, cut onion into quarters; set one quarter aside. Coarsely chop remaining onion. Add chopped onion, carrots, and garlic to Instant Pot, season with a big pinch of salt, and cook on Sauté, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but haven’t taken on color, 6–8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add chiles along with their liquid, adobo sauce, oregano, and cumin to Instant Pot and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add beans, 2 tsp. salt, and 2 quarts water. Lock lid and cook soup at high pressure 20 minutes. Release pressure manually. Taste soup and season with more salt if needed.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice reserved onion and transfer to a small bowl. Add lime juice and remaining ½ tsp. salt. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Using an immersion blender, purée soup in pot until smooth (or, working in batches, purée with a regular blender).</li>
                <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with sour cream, corn chips, cilantro, and drained pickled onions. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>
            </ol>
